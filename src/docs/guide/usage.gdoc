This plugin provides the script [deployer|Scripts] to be used from the command line, or from within the Grails interative mode.  Please see the command line usage for details.

For more advanced use, you can use the org.zirbes.grails.deploy.DeployerService to deploy WAR files from within your application, or from within your own Grails scripts.

Please see the groovy docs for more information on the [ConfigBuilder|api:org.zirbes.grails.deploy.ConfigBuilder] and [DeployerService|api:org.zirbes.grails.deploy.DeployerService] classes.
