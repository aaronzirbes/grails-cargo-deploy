You may enable debugging by enabling the debug log level in log4j in your Config.groovy (or equivalent) configuration file.

{note}
Warning, enabling debugging can potentially write passwords to your log files, so use this with caution.

{code}
log4j = {
	...
	debug   'org.zirbes.grails.deploy'
	...
}
{code}
